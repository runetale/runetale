# Runetale: A New Way to Experience WireGuard Mesh-network

[Runetale](https://www.runetale.com) is a private network infrastructure that leverages WireGuard® technology under the hood.

It is a simple tool designed to upgrade traditional VPNs by providing peer-to-peer, encrypted mesh-network experiences. Runetale facilitates secure connections between teams, machines, cloud infrastructures, smart home devices, and anything else connected to the internet.

For a more comprehensive explanation, please refer to the introductory post [here](https://www.runetale.com/docs/what-is-runetale/).

## Background Story: A Nostalgic Return to Simplicity

**Runetale's mission is to rewind the clock, returning the internet to the simplicity of the 1990s while integrating the numerous advancements that the internet has made over the past 30 years.**

We envision a world where everyone, whether individuals, families, or enterprises, can experience the value of secure internet anytime, anywhere, and with anyone, through customizable internet. (Internally, we call it **"small internet"** reflecting our belief that the internet should be more personalized and tailored.)

Despite the rapid advancement of the public internet from 1G to 5G, private internet appears to be stuck in a time capsule. The reality is, "simply using the internet securely" has become increasingly difficult.

This is the root cause of the growing complexity of the internet.

Through runetale, we're bridging gaps and tackling real-world challenges one step at a time.

## Getting started

NOTE: Runetale is currently a work in progress. **We have started rolling out the [early access signup](https://runetale.com/signup) for our managed service, but please note that the main branch may be unstable.**

NOTE: The guide detailing the technical implementation of runetale will be available soon.

## Roadmap
[Roadmap](https://github.com/runetale/runetale/issues/6) can be found here.

## Decoding "Rune" + "Tale"

Runetale draws its inspiration from the concept of **"delivering the essential value of the internet with a toucoh f magic."**

The Runic alphabet, also known as the Rune Alphabet, originated from the Gothic word "runa," which means "secret." This language was widely used by the Germanic peoples primarily in Northern Europe during the Viking Age.

Our goal is to foster a society where everyone can naturally experience the true magic of the internet. We aim to achieve this by establishing a "common language" in the form of a communication protocol.

When people think of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), they often associate them with features centered around security. However, we strive to transform people's lifestyles through runetale private internet features.

While maintaining security as an integral part of this future, we see ourselves as storytellers, the "tale" in runetale, creating a narrative of a better, personalized internet experience.
